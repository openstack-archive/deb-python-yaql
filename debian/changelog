python-yaql (0.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Also build-depends on python3-ply. This avoids FTBFS, because the package
    was trying to download it from PyPi at build time, when running the unit
    tests. Thanks to Daniel Schepler <dschepler@gmail.com> for the bug report,
    and to Jonathan Wiltshire <jmw@debian.org> for the patch (Closes: #764987).
